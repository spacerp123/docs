# 📄 Create the requirements.txt

It is a **simple text file** that saves a list of **packages** needed by your project.

## How do I create the `requirements.txt` file?

Start by going into your project directory and create a new txt file and make sure it is **named** `requirements.txt`

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/create-requirements.png)

### Putting packages in your `requirements.txt`

{% hint style="warning" %}
The libraries are not the ones you **import** into your code, but the ones you install with **pip install**.
{% endhint %}

#### discord.py (PyPI) (Stable)

Add the following line to your `requirements.txt`

{% code title="requirements.txt" %}
```
discord.py
```
{% endcode %}

When we don't specify a version, pip will always try to install the latest version of the specified package. We can specify versions in the following ways:

> * `discord.py==2.0.0` - Sets a specific version to be installed. Fixing the version in this way ensures that your project will always be working, in case your code is not yet adapted to a higher version
> * `discord.py>=2.0.0`: When we use the `>=` sign we are saying that we want to install any higher or equal version of the library.

#### discord.py (git) (Unstable)

Add the following line to your `requirements.txt`

{% code title="requirements.txt" %}
```python
git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py
```
{% endcode %}

This way we can install **Python** packages that are available on **GitHub** but not on **PyPI**, such as development versions.

### Automatically add packages

If you have **Python** installed on your computer you can run a simple command in your Terminal to put all **the libraries** and **their versions** in a `requirements.txt`

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure you have all the packages your project requires installed on your computer before running
{% endhint %}

Open the Terminal in your project's directory (Windows use: **Shift+Right Button** and click **Open PowerShell**) and run:

```
pip freeze --user > requirements.txt
```

> **--user** - Only output packages installed in user-site

![All dependencies were automatically placed in requirements.txt](../../../.gitbook/assets/pip.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
You need **python** and **pip** installed on your computer, if not, follow the instructions below.
{% endhint %}

### Install `Python` on your computer

> **pip** - Install Python on your computer

> Select your Operating System

### Check the `Python` installation

Open **cmd** or **PowerShell** and type:

```
python --version
```

### Check the `pip` installation

Open **cmd** or **PowerShell** and type:

```
pip -V
```

{% hint style="success" %}
If it returns the version of both then it is installed correctly!
{% endhint %}
