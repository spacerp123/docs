# What is the main file?

## :file\_folder: General main files

The main file is the fundamental code of your bot, making your bot go online and perform other actions automatically. Such as: `index.js`, `bot.js` and `index.py`, depending on what name you put in.

## :file\_folder: Exceptions (defaults)

Some bot making software, such as **Discord Bot Maker** and **Discord Bot Controls**, have a default main file already set up, which is: `bot.js`.
