# How to make a Commit?

Select the files you want to update in your directory, if they are inside any folder, send the folder along with the files so that they are correctly allocated in your directory. After preparing the files, select them and zip \(the format of your compressed folder must be **.zip**\).

If you don't know how to compress your files, see this:

### Discord

Go to the command channel you have access to and type `.commit` \(if you have more than one bot it is necessary to inform the ID\).

Once this is done, a text channel will appear with your Nickname and Tag \(example: \#nickname-1234\).

Within the channel you must send the `.zip` file to make the changes. Once the changes have been made, you will receive a notification on the `🤖┃bots-logs` channel that the changes have been completed.
