You will be automatically added to our Discord server so that you can also do the same actions through Discord. Don't want to host on our website? Book now through Discord!

If you have not yet separated your bot files, go to the Tutorials tab and consult your bot's language. If you already have the files separated into a compressed folder \(`.zip`\), drag them to the website and fill in the required information and, to finish, click the Add Bot button.

If you have any questions about how to correctly fill in your bot's mandatory information on DisCloud, visit the FAQ category in our documentation!
